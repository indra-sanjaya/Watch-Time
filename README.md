# Watch-Time
Binary Tile Clock is a minimalist digital clock built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It visualizes time using a 3×5 tile matrix for each digit, where binary patterns control animated tiles that turn on and off in real time. The project focuses on clean logic, smooth CSS transitions, and DOM-driven rendering—no libraries, no frameworks.
